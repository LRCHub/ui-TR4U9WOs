Everything's so blurry
and everyone's so fake
and everybody's empty
and everything is so messed up
pre-occupied without you
I cannot live at all
my whole world surrounds you
I stumble and I crawl
you could be my someone
you can be my scene
you know that I'll protect you
from all of the obscene
I wonder what your doing
imagine where you are
there's oceans in between us
but that's not very far
can you take it all away
can you take it all away
well you shoved it in my face
this pain you gave to me
can you take it all away
can you take it all away
well you shoved it in my face
everyone is changing
there's no one left that's real
make up your own ending
and let me know
just how you feel
cause I am lost without you
I cannot live at all
my whole world surrounds you
I stumble then I crawl
you could be my someone
you can be my scene
you know that I will save you
from all of the unclean
I wonder what your doing
I wonder where you are
there's oceans in between us
but that's not very far
can you take it all away
can you take it all away
well you shoved it in my face
this pain you gave to me
can you take it all away
can you take it all away
well you shoved it in my face
this pain you gave to me
<♪>
Nobody told me what you thought
nobody told me what to say
everyone showed you
where to turn
told you where to run away
no body told you where to hide
nobody told you what to say
everyone showed you
where to turn
showed you where to run away
can you take it all away
can you take it all away
well you shoved it in my face
this pain you gave to me
can you take it all away
can you take it all away
well you shoved it in my face
this pain you gave to me
explain again to me
you take it all
you take it all away
explain again to me
you take it all away
explain again to me
take it all away
explain again
